# Arduino-Codes-for-Mouse-Latency-Tester
arduino codes of a stopwatch to measure latency, a servo controller, a virtual mouse to measure loop back latency and a stopwatch to measure contact time.  
time_comparison_interrupt_mouse is a stopwatch to measure mouse latency.  
servo_test_360_v3_proto3 is a servo controller.  
time_comparison_interrupt_pc and time_comparison_pclatency_interrupt are codes to measure loop back latency of the PC. Two arduinos are required.  
time_comparison_bouncetime_interrupt is a stopwatch to measure the ON time of a pair of electrical contacts.
